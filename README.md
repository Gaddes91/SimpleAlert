# SimpleAlert

## Topcoder - iOS - Simple Alerts

### Overview
No one likes annoying alerts and pops up while using an application.  In the case of this challenge, we are going to simulate an alert.  Create a timer on the first page of the application that counts down 1 minute.  After the minute is up, the application will pop up an alert, "Please update your license" with two buttons, one cancel, the second button will say Enter Licence. Please follow the Apple HIG's best practices for alerts.

### Tasks
